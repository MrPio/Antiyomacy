# **Antiyomacy**
An implementation of a strategy game heavily inspired by Antiyoy and with some elements of Diplomacy. The project is focused on developing AI software that manages to play the game using the minimax algorithm.

## üé≤ Moves in the game
The two players, Red and Blue, take turns. In each player's turn, they can choose from the following three types of move:

| Move  | How many times it can be made |  
|---|---:|
|***Buy a unit*** | for each province, until its money runs out  |
|***Buy a building***   |  for each province, until its money runs out |
|***Displace a unit***   |  for each unit in each province | 

Now, it is important to note that there are three different ways in which a unit can be moved:
- **Conquer an enemy tile** (if possible): the unit moves to the outer border of its province.
- **Defend the border of its province**: the unit moves inside the inner border of its province.
- **Merge with another unit** (if possible): the unit moves to the location of another unit and the two form a stronger unit.

### Predicates used

**Buy a unit** : 
`province:buy_and_place/8` ---> (`economy:check_buy/3`, `province:place_unit/5` ---> `unit:unit_placement/5` ---> `unit:unit_mergeable/4`)

**Buy a building** : 
`province:buy_and_place/8` ---> (`economy:check_buy/3`, `building:building_placement/4`)

**Displace a unit** : 
`province:displace_unit/8` ---> `province:place_unit/5` ---> `unit:unit_placement/5` ---> `unit:unit_mergeable/4`

## ü™ì Province merge/split algorithm
As you can see in the following image, handling the possibility of merging or splitting provinces after an attack is quite tricky.

This is due to the need for a map scan after each attack. Since the goal of this project revolves around the minimax algorithm, it is clear that runtime performance is of utmost importance. This means that it would be nice to avoid recalculating all provinces on every move (with the `province:find_provinces/2` predicate) due to the complexity of the breadth-first search. Furthermore, even if you did this after every move, there is still the problem of identifying which provinces have split or merged with which other provinces.

That being said, we propose a lazy algorithm that takes advantage of sufficient conditions for both merge and split cases to reduce the use of breadth-first search for province recalculation. Let's break down this algorithm:

### Search for a merge
1. A province merge can only occur after a unit has conquered an unoccupied hex or invaded an enemy hex;
2. If this is the case, find all the player's provinces in the list of the old provinces that touch the area around the conquered hex,
3. Calculate the money of the newly merged province as the sum of the money of these found provinces,
4. Remove these provinces from the list of the provinces.
5. Add the new player's province that was found with a breadth-first search around the conquered hex.

### Search for a split
1. An enemy province split can only occur after a unit has invaded an enemy hex;
2. If this is the case, check if there are any non-adjacent enemy hexes in the surrounding of the invaded hex,
3. If this is the case, select one of these hexes and check that it is not connected to all the other hexes surrounding the invaded hex, using a breadth-first search,
4. If this is the case, a split has certainly occurred. Find all the provinces using a breadth-first on the enemy hexes surrounding the invaded hex,
5. Select the split province from the list of the old provinces and use it to calculate the new split provinces' money,
6. Remove the former and add the latter to the list of the provinces.
7. Otherwise, if the split hasn't happened, the invaded enemy province will still have to be recalculated due to the attack.

The use of these two predicates in sequences makes it possible to detect the occurrence of both simultaneous splitting and merging.
These two algorithms are implemented in the predicates `province:check_for_merge/5` and `province:check_for_split/5` respectively.
